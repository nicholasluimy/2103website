	Itâ€™s immaterial how much the product is improved between versions, as long as it improves. If you are
	stressed about the workload, you may chose to do less for some intermediate versions. However, we expect
	you to spread out your work over the semester reasonably consistently. For example, doing very little in
	V0.1-V0.4 and doing a whole lot in V0.5 is liable for a penalty.
