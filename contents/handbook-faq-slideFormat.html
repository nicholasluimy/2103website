<p>Slides are not meant to be documents to print and study for exams. Their purpose is to support 
the lecture delivery and keep you engaged during the lecture. That's why our slides are less 
detailed and more visual.</p>
<p>Handouts are wordy because they are reference materials for you  to study at your own pace and 
use during the module and later. The format is similar to materials (books, online articles, etc.) 
you will have to refer to  when you work in the industry. They too are not meant to be cheat 
sheets 'to study for exams with minimal effort'.</p>
